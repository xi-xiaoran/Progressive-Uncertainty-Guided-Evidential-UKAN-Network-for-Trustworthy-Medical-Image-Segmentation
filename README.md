## Project Description:

Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, and imposes strict requirements on the accuracy and reliability of models. Most existing methods adopt a strategy based on evidence uncertainty perception. Although it can provide segmentation results and uncertainty measures, achieving a certain degree of trustworthy segmentation, there are still limitations. Firstly, the insufficient learning of difficult samples leads to a significant decrease in the segmentation performance of the model on such samples. Secondly, the low accuracy of evidence uncertainty evaluation limits the model's trustworthy deployment ability. In response to the above issues, this paper proposes a Progressive Uncertainty Guided Empirical UKAN (PUGEUKAN) model for trustworthy medical image segmentation. The model introduces an Uncertainty Attention Block (UAB) module to guide the model to focus on difficult samples using uncertainty maps, thereby improving segmentation accuracy and robustness; Designed an evidence regularization term that integrates prior information and a novel evidence head function to enhance the accuracy of uncertainty estimation; Adopting a multi-scale receptive field module (Multi Dilation Block, MDB) combined with gating mechanism to effectively model the scale differences of lesion areas and further improve segmentation performance. The experimental results on the CVC LinicDB dataset show that PUGEUKAN has improved uncertainty estimation ability by 17.8%, Dice coefficient by 0.6%, and IoU by 0.7% compared to existing mainstream methods such as UKAN and SwinUNETR, significantly verifying its advantages in medical image segmentation.
